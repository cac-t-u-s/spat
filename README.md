# Spat library for om# 

The **spat** library for om# allows to create and render spatial scenes using [Spat5](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/spat-en/).

The SPAT-DSP and SPAT-SCENE objects provide graphical controllers from the Spat library, as well as real-time audio rendering and OSC data streaming.

_This library does NOT include Spat sources or binaries, which must be installed separately and (if necessary) located in the Spat section of OM Preferences/Libraries tab._
